# Uncommon MATLAB Errors: Negative Input and Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a MATLAB function containing two potential errors:

1. **Improper handling of negative inputs:** The `myFunction` does not correctly handle cases where the input is negative.
2. **Potential division by zero:** The `someCalculation` function can lead to division by zero if the input is 5.

The `bug.m` file contains the code with the errors, and `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected version with error handling.
